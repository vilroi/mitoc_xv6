### Implementation of pipes:

I have created the following shell script, and have ran the following command. 
```bash
    > cat test.sh
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        sleep inifinity
        cat file.out

    ./test.sh | sort | uniq
```

The resulting process tree is shown below. 
``` bash
    bash(27755)-+-bash(27761)---sleep(27764)
                |-sort(27762)
                `-uniq(27763)
```

As shown by the output of pstree, the three processes that are connected with pipes are all siblings, and share a common parent.
It is the responsibility of the parent process to wait(2), allowing the system to release the associated resources of the cihld.

Perhaps something like the following is needed:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < nchild; i++) 
        wait(NULL)
```

With the current implementation, the process tree is like the following:
```bash
make(45343)───sh(45344)───xv6sh(45345)───xv6sh(45347)───xv6sh(45349)─┬─sort(45350)    
                                                                     └─xv6sh(45351)─┬─uniq(45352)
                                                                                    └─wc(45353)
```
